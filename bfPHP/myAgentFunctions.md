# Overview of the Agent Functions Class

This document details the implementation of the `agentFunctions` class which extends functionality from a base agent through the use of natural language processing (NLP) capabilities.

## Purpose

The primary goal of the `agentFunctions` class is to enhance an agent's ability to Encapsulate the ovon messaging to simplify it to a simple text in and text out chatbot.  you would put your code inside the various functions to respond to an utterance or a whisper or an invitation.

## Key Components

- **Initialization and Setup**: The constructor initializes the NLP component using a JSON file (`intentConcepts.json`) which contains data related to different intents. This is just an example of how to make a simple bot you are free to put any sort of  chatbot engine inside these functions.

- **Persistent Context Management**: Methods such as `startUpAction` and `wrapUpAction` permit set up and tear down of any functionality you need for your agent. In addition it canfacilitate the retrieval and storage of context information across interactions, which can be used for maintaining state or continuity over sessions, if needed.

- **Handling User Interaction**:
  - **inviteAction**: This method provides an initial greeting to users to start interaction. This is the first turn of the interaction with the user so anything that needs to be initialized or any special greetings would be done here.
  - **utteranceAction**: This method receives the user's spoken or typed input, processes that input ( e.g.  the simple NLP that the example does),  and then constructs  and returns a response.  That response is then wrapped in an OVON envelope and returned to the user platform.
  - **whisperAction**: Similar to `utteranceAction`, this handles private user input. It's meant for handling private communications with the agent.

## Usefulness

This implementation also demonstrates modularity by leveraging a simple NLP engine (`SimpleNLP`) and allows for easy extension through modifications in the included JSON configuration for intents, promoting adaptability to different domains or languages.

Overall, this class serves as an simple template for creating an OVON compliant, responsive virtual agent capable of conversation with a user using the OVON standard.
