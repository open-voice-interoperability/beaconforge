# Documentation: `SimpleNLP` PHP Class

The `SimpleNLP` class is designed to perform basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) operations. It reads a JSON file containing predefined concepts and their examples, and it matches these against input text messages to identify intents. This class provides foundational functionality for analyzing text and extracting intents based on predefined word lists.

## Class: `SimpleNLP`

### Properties

- **$myConcepts** (private array|null): Holds the JSON-decoded content of the concept file if successfully read and parsed.

### Constructor

#### `__construct($fileName)`

- **Parameters**: 
  - **$fileName** (string): The path to a JSON file containing concept definitions.
  
- **Functionality**: 
  - Attempts to read the specified file and decode the JSON content to populate `$myConcepts`.
  - Validates that the content length exceeds 40 characters and checks for JSON parse errors.
  - Displays an error message if the file content is invalid or a decoding error occurs.

### Methods

#### `ejSimpleIntentFromText($inputMessage)`

- **Parameters**: 
  - **$inputMessage** (string): The input text message to analyze.

- **Returns**: 
  - An array of matched concepts and corresponding words found in the input message.

- **Functionality**:
  - Normalizes the input message by removing non-word characters and converting it to lowercase.
  - Iterates over each concept in `$myConcepts` to check if any example words exist within the input message.
  - Adds matched concepts and words to the result array and returns it.

#### `ejSimpleIntent($conceptJSON)`

- **Parameters**: 
  - **$conceptJSON** (array): An array containing concept data extracted from the input message.

- **Returns**: 
  - An associative array detailing the intent extracted from the provided concept data.

- **Functionality**:
  - Initializes a default intent structure with flags and placeholders.
  - Iterates through the provided concept data and updates the intent structure based on specific concept matches (`return`, `delegate`, `assistantName`, etc.).
  - Returns the structured intent information.

## Usage Considerations

- Ensure the JSON file provided to the constructor is correctly formatted and contains a `concepts` array with named concepts and examples.
- This class is not designed to handle complex NLP tasks but can efficiently find and categorize simple intents based on explicit word matches.
- The user should verify input processing, especially around special characters and case sensitivity, to ensure accurate matching.

This class provides the basic mechanism for concept matching from textual input, aiding in simple NLP tasks and intent detection using a pre-defined dictionary of concepts and examples.
